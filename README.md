# React Coding Standards

This document outlines the coding standards for writing React code. These standards are meant to ensure code consistency, maintainability, and readability across the codebase.

## General Principles

- Follow the react style guide: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react
- Write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
- Write code that is testable and has clear functionality.
- Keep your code as concise as possible, without sacrificing readability.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and abstractions.

## File Structure

- Use a modular file structure, where each component or feature is contained in its own folder.
- Name files using `PascalCase` for components and `camelCase` for all other files (e.g., `MyComponent.js`, `myUtil.js`).
- Keep file names consistent with the component or feature they represent.

## Naming Conventions

- Use `PascalCase` for React components and `camelCase` for all other variables, functions, and file names.
- Prefix private variables and functions with an underscore (e.g., `_myPrivateFunction()`).
- Use descriptive and meaningful names that accurately represent the function or variable they represent.

## Component Structure

- Components should be small, focused, and reusable.
- Use stateless functional components when possible, as they are more performant and easier to test.
- Use class components when you need to manage state or use lifecycle methods.
- Keep components as pure as possible by minimizing side effects.
- Divide components into smaller sub-components when they become too complex.

## Props and State

- Use `props` to pass data down from parent components to child components.
- Avoid modifying `props` directly in child components; instead, use `state` to manage component-specific data.
- Use `setState()` to update `state`.
- Avoid using `forceUpdate()` and mutating `state` directly.
- Keep `state` as simple as possible, avoiding nested objects and arrays.

## Styling

- Use a consistent and organized approach to styling, such as CSS-in-JS or a CSS preprocessor.
- Avoid inline styles and hard-coded style values.
- Use a responsive design approach to ensure that your components look good on all devices.
- Use meaningful class names that accurately represent the content and purpose of the element.

## Testing

- Write tests for all components and functionality.
- Use test-driven development (TDD) to ensure that your code is testable and functional.
- Use a testing framework such as Jest or Enzyme.
- Test all possible scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.

## Documentation

- Document your code using inline comments and README files.
- Use JSDoc-style comments to document functions and components.
- Include information about the function or component's parameters, return values, and any side effects.
- Use a README file to document the purpose and functionality of the component or feature.

# Contribution by Yash8840
1. In App.js, moved the "flashcards" array declaration outside the component function and added a new pokemon card(pickachu) for guessing.

2. In app.js, to add the functionality of checking answer when "enter" is pressed, removed the state management for input element and instead added ref(also, ref doesn't trigger re-render).
